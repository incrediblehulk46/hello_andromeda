# hello_andromeda
Just another repository to start with the basics of git and explore all complexities of it.


hi all aliens out there reading this bunch of shit.
you never know what this human civilisation has to offer you all untill you get to these dumb people
not all are dumb only the first hand representatives out there. and a bunch of others.

I guess this is enough shit for a first time edit for such git readme repsitory. I will come back here for you all aliens and some changes as i feel good to inform or when these stupid bunch of mf stop doing all sorts of mfs and concentrate only on making this universe last forever so that we escape this bullshit and come close to a higher good.
